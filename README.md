# Alien Cipher (GitHub Pages)

This is a single-file, password-only "alien language" encoder/decoder.

- Anyone with the same password can decrypt.
- Each user can customize the UI (name/icon/accent/transparency) and it saves locally in their own browser (localStorage).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Upload `index.html` to a new GitHub repo.
2. Repo Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` + `/ (root)`.
